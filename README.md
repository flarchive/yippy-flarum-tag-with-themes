This extension allows Administrators to display different themes for discussions with tags.

## Installation

This extension requires PHP 7.4 or higher.

    `composer require yippy/flarum-tag-with-themes`

You must run this command for this extension to work, this is because the assets command will include select2 for the dropdown menu to work.

    `php flarum assets:publish`

![Run Flarum Assets Command](https://github.com/Yippy/flarum-tag-with-themes/raw/main/assets/images/run_flarum_assets_command.png)

If you are unable to run that command, and the dropdown menu is still not working. You can copy the [asset manually](https://github.com/Yippy/flarum-tag-with-themes/tree/main/assets) and move it to the [FLARUM_DATA_DIRECTORY]\assets\extensions\yippy-tag-with-themes\ folder.

## Flarum Tag with Themes

 This was created to allow Administrators to change the entire dicussion with Tag Theming, this can be done for assigned User Permission Groups or individual Tags.
 
 You are able to assign the default as None, and just add customisation to only show Tag with Themes for specific Tags.
 
 Currently there is 24 styles of themes, and in the future there can be additional themes.
